<br /><em><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/EngineDriver/changelog-and-todo-list.txt" target="_blank" title="View complete EngineDriver changelog">[view complete changelog]</a></em></p>
<p>This free application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a computer, 
and in turn control your DCC locomotives and other devices. 
Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one to three locos or consists.  
You can create and edit consists (software-defined).  
You can also control layout power, turnouts and routes, and display panels and other JMRI windows using the web views.</p>
<p>For more details, visit <a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org" target="_blank">[EngineDriver&nbsp;site]</a>. For screenshots, click <a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org/content/screenshots" target="_blank">[here]</a>.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>Verify your Android device can connect to your PC network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br />Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JMRI</a> (2.8 works, 3.0+ works much better) on your PC, connected to your layout.&nbsp; Start up JMRI and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco on your layout.</p>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">WiThrottle</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools, Throttles.&nbsp; It is also hghly recommended that you start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/web/index.shtml" target="_blank" title="Learn more about JMRI Web Server">JMRI Web Server</a>
function (Tools, Start JMRI Web Server).&nbsp; 
Both of these should be added to Preferences, Start Up as well.</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your PC's address to show up in "Discovered Services".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the discovered address, or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server directly.&nbsp; 
(Using the values shown on the WiThrottle window.)<br /> 
There is also a "demo" server at jmri.mstevetodd.com, port 44444 that you can connect to for testing.</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Press to Select" loco button for each loco.<br />On the next screen, click on a loco from the roster list, 
or enter the loco address (verify short or long), and press "Acquire". You will be returned to the Throttle screen.<br />
Repeat using 2nd and 3rd "Press to Select" buttons to acquire a 2nd or 3rd train.<br />
Note: press and hold a roster item to see additional details from the roster.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider (or volume control) (or arrow buttons) for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br />
To release all locos, just press the Back button and exit the app. This will also stop your locos (can be overridden in preferences). 
You can reassign the volume control by clicking on the speed indicator (the small "v" shows which has control).</p>
<p>To create a consist "on-the-fly", simply select additional locos for the same throttle.  You will be prompted for the direction of each new loco relative to the existing consist. 
Direction and speed will be sent for all. 
Release will release all for that throttle.</p>
<p>Press your phone's Menu button to access screens for Turnout, Route and Power control, as well as adjust settings and set numerous preferences.</p>
<p>You can also "fling" left or right to jump quickly back and forth between the Throttle, Routes and Turnouts pages.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, there is an extensive list of options where you can customize the screens 
and actions of EngineDriver to work best with your device, your layout and your personal style.
These include fast clock display, speed step options, web views, button size, additional buttons, 
slider size and behavior, number of throttles to display, 
stop on release, allow/disallow on-the-fly consisting, autoconnect, and many more.  
</p>
<p>If you have entered function labels for a roster entry in JMRI, these labels will be used.  
If not, you can use the Function Defaults menu option to set default labels and function numbers to display.&nbsp; Remove buttons by blanking out the labels.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the control features desired.&nbsp; 
If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, make sure to specify "user names" for those you'd like to see listed on your throttle.&nbsp; 
You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the WiThrottle window.&nbsp; 
Turning on "Use eStop" and "Use fixed port#" are also recommended.</p>
<p>Entering roster entries, and defining routes and turnouts in JMRI will all make your Engine Driver throttle more powerful and easier to use (though not required).&nbsp; 
EngineDriver will show additional info if the JMRI Web Server is started (such as roster details and icon images).</p>
