<h1>JMRI: Engine Driver Throttle for Android</h1>
<img src="file:///android_asset/engine_driver_icon.png" height="144" width="166" style="float:left;padding:0 8px 8px 0"/>
<p>Engine Driver version 1.3. This version fixes a small bug.<br /><em><a href="http://jmri.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmri/trunk/EngineDriver/changelog-and-todo-list.txt" target="_blank" title="View complete EngineDriver changelog">[view complete changelog]</a></em></p>
<p>This free application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a computer, and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one or two locomotives. &nbsp;You can also control layout power, turnouts and routes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>Verify your Android device can connect to your PC network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br />Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JMRI</a>&nbsp;(2.8 works, 2.10 works better) on your PC, connected to the layout. &nbsp;Start up JMRI and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco.</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">WiThrottle</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools, Throttles. &nbsp;(Or under Debug in older versions of JMRI).</p>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your PC's address to show up in "Discovered Services". <br />Click on the discovered address, (or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server directly).</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Press to Select" loco button for each loco.<br />On the next screen, enter the loco address (verify short or long), and press "Acquire". &nbsp;You will be returned to the Throttle screen.<br />Repeat using 2nd "Press to Select" button to acquire a 2nd loco.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider (or volume control) for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br />To release all locos, just press the Back button.  This will also stop your loco (can be overridden in preferences).  
You can reassign the volume control by clicking on the speed indicator (the small "v" shows which has control).</p>
<p>Press your phone's Menu button to access screens for Turnout, Route and Power control, as well as adjust settings and setup default function labels.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, set the name you'd like to call your throttle. &nbsp;(Must be unique if multiple EngineDrivers in use) &nbsp;You can turn off the "stop on release" feature if desired, and you can set a Maximum value for the throttle sliders. &nbsp;If you're planning to use Turnout control, make sure you select the correct Hardware System from the list. &nbsp; If the throttle slider is too small for you fingers, increase the size in Preferences.</p>
<p>Use the Function Buttons menu option to set the labels and function numbers to display. If you have entered labels for a roster entry in JMRI, these labels will be used for that entry, and can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). &nbsp;Remove buttons by blanking out the labels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the control features desired. &nbsp;If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, make sure to specify "user names" for those you'd like to see listed on your throttle. &nbsp;You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the WiThrottle window. &nbsp;Turning on "Use eStop" and "Use fixed port#" are also recommended.</p>
<p>Entering roster entries, routes and defining turnouts in JMRI will all make your Engine Driver throttle easier to use (though not required).</p>
