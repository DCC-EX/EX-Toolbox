<p>Engine Driver version 0.3 is now available. This version includes numerous cosmetic and error-handling improvements, and allows the user to set function labels (or copy them from JMRI roster if available).</p>
<p>This application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a PC, and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and up to 16 functions are supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, on your Android phone, search the Market app for "Engine Driver" and download and install it. &nbsp;Verify your Android can connect to your PC network via WiFi and get an address.</p>
<p>Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/">JMRI</a> (2.8 works, 2.9.6 works better) on your PC, connected to the layout. &nbsp;Verify you can use the "Throttle" app to control a loco.</p>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">WiThrottle</a> function on JMRI.</p>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app, and shortly, your PC address should show up in "Discovered Services". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on that address.</p>
<p>Enter the loco address, select short or long addressing, and press "Connect".</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction.</p>
<p>To release that loco, just press the Back button.</p>
<p>Use the Function Buttons menu option to set the labels and function numbers to display.  Blank labels will not display, so you can limit the buttons shown to those most useful to you.  If you have set labels in a roster entry in JMRI, these labels can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco).
<p>New version is 0.3, available in the Android Market.</p>
<p>Previous versions are here:<br />version 0.2:&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/Engine_Driver-debug_v0.2.apk">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/Engine_Driver-debug_v0.2.apk<br /></a>version 0.1:&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/Engine_Driver-debug_v0.1.apk">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/Engine_Driver-debug_v0.1.apk</a></p>
