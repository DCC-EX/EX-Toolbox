<h1>JMRI: Engine Driver Throttle for Android</h1>
<img src="file:///android_asset/icon_large.png" width=100 height=100 style="float:left;padding:0 8px 8px 0"/>
<p>Engine Driver version 0.4. This version adds a 2nd throttle control.</p>
<p>This application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a PC, and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and up to 16 functions are supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before your Android device will allow you to install this program, you will need to permit the installation of non-Market applications. 
This is under Settings->Applications->Unknown sources.  Then use your phone to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/EngineDriver-0.3.apk/download">download this file</a>, 
and select it for installation.</p>
<p>Verify your Android can connect to your PC network via WiFi and get an address.</p>
<p>Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/">JMRI</a> (2.8 works, 2.9.6 works better) on your PC, connected to the layout. &nbsp;Verify you can use the "Throttle" app to control a loco.</p>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">WiThrottle</a> function on JMRI.</p>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app, and shortly, your PC address should show up in "Discovered Services". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on that address, or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server directly.</p>
<p>On the next screen, enter the loco address, select short or long addressing, and press "Connect".</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction.</p>
<p>To release that loco, just press the Back button.  This will also stop your loco (can be overridden in preferences).</p>
<p>Use the Function Buttons menu option to set the labels and function numbers to display.  Blank labels will not display, so you can limit the buttons shown to those most useful to you.  If you have set labels in a roster entry in JMRI, these labels can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco).
<p>New version is 0.4, available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/EngineDriver-0.4.apk">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/EngineDriver-0.3.apk</a> and (soon) in the Android Market.</p>
