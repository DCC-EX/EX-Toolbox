<h1>JMRI: Engine Driver Throttle for Android</h1>
<img src="file:///android_asset/engine_driver_icon.png" height="144" width="166" style="float:left;padding:0 8px 8px 0"/>
<p>Engine Driver version 0.7 is now available.&nbsp;This version adds Turnout, Route and Layout Power control pages, all accessed via menu from the Throttle screen.</p>
<p>This free application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a computer, and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one or two locomotives. &nbsp;You can also control layout power, turnouts and routes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>Verify your Android device can connect to your PC network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br />Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JMRI</a>&nbsp;(2.8 works, 2.10 works better) on your PC, connected to the layout. &nbsp;Start up JMRI and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco.</p>
<h3>Installation:</h3>
<p>Download and install from the Android Market as usual. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, you can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/EngineDriver-0.7.apk/download" target="_blank">download this file</a>&nbsp;from the JMRI site using your phone or another computer. &nbsp;Before your Android device will allow you to install this file, you will need to permit the installation of non-Market applications.  This is under Settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;Unknown sources. Once on your phone, click on the file to begin installation. &nbsp;Follow the prompts as usual. &nbsp;(Note: if you have an earlier version installed, you may need to uninstall it manually.)</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">WiThrottle</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools, Throttles. &nbsp;(Or under Debug in older versions of JMRI).</p>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your PC's address to show up in "Discovered Services". <br />Click on the discovered address, (or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server directly).</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Press to Select" loco button for each loco.</p>
<p>On the next screen, enter the loco address (verify short or long), and press "Acquire". &nbsp;You will be returned to the Throttle screen.</p>
<p>Repeat using 2nd "Press to Select" button to acquire a 2nd loco.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br />To release all locos, just press the Back button.  This will also stop your loco (can be overridden in preferences).</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, set the name you'd like to call your throttle. &nbsp;(Must be unique if multiple EngineDrivers in use) &nbsp;You can turn off the "stop on release" feature if desired, and you can set a Maximum value for the throttle sliders. &nbsp;If you're planning to use Turnout control, make sure you select the correct Hardware System from the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Function Buttons menu option to set the labels and function numbers to display. If you have set labels in a roster entry in JMRI, these labels can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). &nbsp;Remove buttons by blanking out the labels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the control features desired. &nbsp;If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, make sure to specify "user names" for those you'd like to see listed on your throttle. &nbsp;You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the WiThrottle window. &nbsp;Turning on "Use eStop" and "Use fixed port#" are also recommended.</p>
