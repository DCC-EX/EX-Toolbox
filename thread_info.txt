<Renfield> How do I spawn a thread that survives the Activity from which it is spawned?
<-- aunn has quit (Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer))
<moraes> i thought "Toast" was a funny name but i just found "BoringLayout"
<ctate> dmb__: it wasn't a Palm Pilot.  It was a Palm pda.  :)
<ctate> [seriously, they were forced to stop using the "Pilot" name in 1998]
<mikedg> toast is common
<ctate> Renfield: all spawned t hreads survive the activity
<ctate> Renfield: typically the AsyncTask class will provide the functionality you need
<-- spearce has quit ()
<ctate> either that or starting your own Handler
<-- r0bby has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
<Renfield> ctate Ok, thanks. How do I get at that thread from a different Activity?
<dmb__> ctate, you worked for palm?
--> r0bby (n=wakawaka@guifications/user/r0bby) has joined #android-dev
<dmb__> oh
<dmb__> read that wrong :P
<ctate> Renfield: cache a pointer to it in the Application object
<dmb__> ctate, well, its very possible that this device was from 1998 or before
<Renfield> ctate Awesome thanks so much.
<ctate> dmb__: i worked for Palm and PalmSource at one point
<dmb__> i have to look for it someday
