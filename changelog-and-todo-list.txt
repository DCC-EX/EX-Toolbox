 *   
 * Other potential changes to WiThrottle:
 *   ) remove throttle from withrottle screen on loss of connection (estop)
 *   ) add response for heartbeat (so client will know it's still alive)  status message would be ideal
 *   ) allow restart of withrottle (variable UI needs to be cleared when it closes)
 *   ) fix read error looping on loss of connection to device
 *   ) add "E"rror response
