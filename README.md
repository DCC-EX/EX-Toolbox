# EX-Toolbox
<h1>EX-Toolbox for DCC-EX</h1>
<p><b>Changes for this version include:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>CV Programming on the programming track (Service Mode)</li>
    <li>CV Programming on the main track (Operation Mode)</li>
    <li>Track Manger</li>
    <li>Servo testing</li>
</ul>
<p>This free Android application connects to a
    <a href="https://dcc_ex.com" target="_blank">DCC-EX EX-CommandStation</a> using the native DCC-EX command protocol (only).
    Once connected, you can configure aspects of your EX-CommandStation including programming CVs.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites <br /> (for DCC-EX EX-CommandStation):</h3>
<p>EX-Toolbox can only connect directly to DCC-EX EX-CommandStations, that are in Station Mode or
    Access Point Mode, using the native DCC-EX command protocol.
    If you use the native DCC-EX commands an additional menu item (DCC-EX) will be available for
    programming CVs and other functions. <br />
</p>

<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>On your phone, start the EX-Toolbox app and wait for your server's address to show up in
    "Discovered Services".</p>
<p>Click on the discovered address, or you can enter the address and port of your EX-CommandStation server
    directly. (Using the values shown on the window.)<br/>
    There is an "Auto-Connect to First Server?" preference you can enable if desired.
    </p>
<h3>Development:</h3>
<p>Engine Driver is free and open source software, part of the
    <a href="http://dcc-ex" target="_blank">DCC-EX</a> project. It is built in
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/" target="_blank">Android&nbsp;Studio</a>.
    It is based heavily on M.Steve Todd's Engine Driver app source code.
